# Contributing to MyNextApp

Welcome to MyNextApp! We’re thrilled you’re considering contributing to our
project, which is deployed on Kubernetes and built with Next.js and React.

## Getting Started

*   **Fork this repository:**
    [https://github.com/your-username/mynextapp](https://github.com/your-username/my[https://github.com/your-username/mynextapp](https//github.com/your-username/mynextapp)
*   **Clone your fork:** `git clone
https://github.com/your-username/mynextapp.git`
*   **Set up your local environment:**
    [https://github.com/your-username/mynextapp/wiki/Setup](https://github.com/your-[https://github.com/your-username/mynextap/wiki/Setup](https://github.com/your-username/mynextapp/wiki/Setup) (This page contains detailed instructions on
    installing Node.js, yarn/npm, and the necessary Kubernetes tools.)

## Coding Standards & Best Practices

*   **Code Style:** We use ESLint with Next.js configurations and Prettier.
    Ensure your code adheres to these standards.
*   **Commit Messages:** Use concise and descriptive commit messages. Follow
    the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
    Example: `feat: Implement user registration flow`
*   **React & Next.js Specifics:**
    *   Follow React’s component lifecycle methods and best practices for state
        management (consider Hooks, Redux, or Context API).
    *   Optimize Next.js routes for performance.  Use Server-Side Rendering
        (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) appropriately.
    *   Utilize Next.js’s data fetching APIs (`getServerSideProps`,
        `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`).
*   **Keep it Small:** Create small, focused pull requests.  A single pull
    request should address a single logical change.
*   **Test Your Code:** Write unit tests for React components and integration
    tests to ensure they function correctly in the Next.js environment.

## Kubernetes & Deployment

*   **Kubernetes Manifests:** All changes to Kubernetes manifests (Deployments,
    Services, Ingresses, etc.) *must* be reviewed and approved by a senior team
    member. These changes can have a significant impact on the deployment.
*   **Image Builds:** When creating new Docker images for your application,
    follow our
    [https://github.com/your-username/mynextapp/wiki/Docker](https://github.com/your[https://github.com/your-username/mynextapp/wiki/Docker](https://githb.com/your-username/mynextapp/wiki/Docker) documentation. Use multi-stage builds for
    optimization.
*   **Resource Limits:** Be mindful of resource requests and limits for your
    pods.

## Contribution Workflow

1.  **Create a Branch:** As described above.
2.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your feature or fix.
3.  **Test Thoroughly:** Run all tests and perform manual testing in a local
    Kubernetes environment or using a staging deployment.
4.  **Commit Your Changes:** `git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"`
5.  **Push to Your Fork:** `git push origin your-feature-branch`
6.  **Create a Pull Request:** Navigate to your fork on GitHub and click "New
    Pull Request."
7.  **Respond to Feedback:** Address any feedback from reviewers promptly.

## Reporting Bugs & Issues

*   Please report bugs and issues on
    [https://github.com/your-username/mynextapp/issues](https://github.com/your-user[https://github.com/your-username/mynextappissues](https://github.com/your-username/mynextapp/issues).
*   When reporting an issue, provide as much detail as possible:
    *   Steps to reproduce the issue.
